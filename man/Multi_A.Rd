\title{Microarray data set of Su on different mammalian tissue types}
\description{
  Microarray data from Broad
  Institute \dQuote{Cancer Program Data Sets} which
  was produced by Su et al. 2002.

  Gene expression from human and mouse samples across a diverse array
  of tissues, organs, and cell lines have been profiled.
  The goal was to have a reference for the normal mammalian transcriptome.

  Here we want to identify the subclasses which correspond to the tissue
  types.
